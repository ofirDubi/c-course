question 1:
a. always incorrect. a proof that an array is saved as a consecutive block
	in the memory can be found in the book "The C programming language" on page
	98: "int a[10]; 
		defines an array of size 10, that is, a block of 10 consecutive objects
		named a[0], a[1], ..., a[9]"
b. always currect. a proof that argv is a pointer to an array, thus
	it can be manipulated can be found  in the book "The C programming language"
	on page 115: "Sience argv is a pointer to an array of pointers, we can manipulate the
				  pointer rather than index the array"
